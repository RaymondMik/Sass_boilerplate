# Sass Starter Kit
A simple Sass setup that can be easily implemented into web app projects.

<h2>How to use it</h2>
If you haven't already, install Sass on your computer. You can learn more about Sass <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="blank">here</a><br>
Download the Sass Starter Kit folder and add it to your project, for instance into a folder named "styles". 
Include the <code>app.css</code> file to your project, since Sass will compile your CSS there. 
Using the Terminal (Mac OS) or Command Prompt (Windows OS), move into the folder containing the Sass starter kit and run the command <code>sass --watch app.scss:app.css</code>
That's it! Everytime you made a change to your <code>.scss</code> files Sass will automatically compile and add them to your <code>app.css</code> file.
