# Sass Starter Kit
A simple Sass setup that can be easily implemented into your projects.

<h2>How to use it</h2>
If you haven't already, install Sass on your computer. You can learn how to install and use Sass <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="blank">here</a>.<br>
Then, just follow this steps:
<ol>
  <li>Download the Sass Starter Kit files and add it to your project into a dedicated folder. </li>
  <li>Include the <code>app.css</code> file into your project, since Sass will compile your CSS there. </li>
  <li>Using the Terminal (Mac OS) or Command Prompt (Windows OS), move into the folder containing the Sass starter kit and run the command <code>sass --watch app.scss:app.css</code></li>
</ol>
That's it! Everytime you made a change to your <code>.scss</code> files Sass will automatically compile and bundle them into your main <code>app.css</code> file.

<h4>Sass Version</h4>
There is a Sass version available in a separate branch called 'sass_version'.
